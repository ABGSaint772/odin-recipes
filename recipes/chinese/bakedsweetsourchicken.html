    <h1>Baked Sweet and Sour Chicken Recipe</h1>
    <p>Baked Sweet and Sour Chicken is a delicious dish where tender chicken pieces are coated in a crispy, golden breading and then baked to perfection. The star of the dish is the tangy-sweet sauce, made from a blend of ingredients like vinegar, sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, and sometimes pineapple juice, which gives it that signature sweet and sour flavor.</p>

                    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) with racks in upper and lower third positions. Grease each of 2 baking sheets with 1 tablespoon of the oil along 1 of the short sides; set aside.</li><br>

                    <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and place in a bowl. Add eggs, and stir to coat. Place flour in a shallow bowl or baking dish. Working in batches, dredge chicken in flour, and shake off excess. Divide chicken between the prepared baking sheets, spreading in an even layer along short edges.</li><br>

                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until chicken is browned in spots, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken and bell peppers from the oven; use a spatula to carefully flip chicken only . Return to the oven, and continue baking at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) until chicken is crispy and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 5 minutes.</li><br>

                    <li>While chicken is baking, whisk together ketchup, pineapple juice, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium, whisking occasionally. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low, and cook, stirring often, until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup and coats back of spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li><br>
