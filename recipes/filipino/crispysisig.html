    <h1>Crispy Sisig Recipe</h1>
    <p>Crispy Sisig is a popular Filipino dish known for its bold, savory flavors and crunchy texture. It's a dish made from pork (usually parts like the face, ears, and sometimes liver) that's been simmered, chopped, and then crisped up to perfection. Sisig is typically served sizzling on a hot plate and is often enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or even as a main course.</p>

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Let's begin by getting a pot and filling it with water then add salt, onion wedges and the pork belly or lechon kawali. Cook until tender. Drain from the water and set aside on a plate or tray to cool and air-dry.</li><br>

                    <li>Get a shallow pan and make it nice and hot. Pour enough oil and deep fry tenderized pork until crisp and golden brown. Let cool and chop coarsely.</li><br>

                    <li>Using another pan, throw in the garlic and liver. Saute until fully cooked.</li><br>

                    <li>Off heat, toss in the onions, chopped crispy pork and green chillies. Season with more Knorr Liquid Seasoning, calamansi juice and pepper. And that's it!</li><br>
