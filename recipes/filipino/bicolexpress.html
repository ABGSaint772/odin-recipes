    <h1>Bicol Express Recipe</h1>
    <p>Crispy Sisig is a popular Filipino dish known for its bold, savory flavors and crunchy texture. It's a dish made from pork (usually parts like the face, ears, and sometimes liver) that's been simmered, chopped, and then crisped up to perfection. Sisig is typically served sizzling on a hot plate and is often enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or even as a main course.</p>

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium sized pot, get it nice and hot on medium-high heat. When hot enough, pour in a little oil and throw in the onions, garlic, ginger and shrimp paste.</li><br>

                    <li>Mash the shrimp paste and saut√© the vegetables until you can smell the lovely aroma from the combined ingredients. </li><br>

                    <li>It's time to add the pork. Allow the pork to cook for just a minute together with the aromatics (onions, garlic and ginger) to remove the gamey taste of the meat.</li><br>

                    <li>You may now pour the dissolved Knorr Complete Recipe Mix Ginataang Gulay and bring this to a boil. Adjust your heat to low and cook this to simmer before adding the chilies. Stir once in a while then finish by cooking the pork until tender. Served this dish hot.</li><br>
