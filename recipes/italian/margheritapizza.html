    <h1>Margherita Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <p>Margherita pizza is a Neapolitan classic that celebrates simplicity and high-quality ingredients. It's made with a soft, chewy crust; San Marzano tomatoes; fresh mozzarella; basil; and a drizzle of olive oil. It represents the colors of the Italian flagâ€”red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil).<br>
This pizza is so iconic that its traditional preparation is protected by Italian culinary law and international standards like the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN).</p>

                <h3>How to make the Dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix the water and 1 gram of yeast in the mixing bowl.</li><br>
                    <li>Add roughly 15-20% of flour in the bowl and mix it.</li><br>
                    <li>Add another 15-20% of flour and mix and repeat the process.</li><br>
                    <li>Before adding the remaining flour add the 30 grams of salt.</li><br>
                    <li>Take out the dough and knead on the table for 5-10 minutes until it looks smooth.<br>
                        Poke the dough with your finger and if it bounces back to it's original it's done.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Cover the dough with damp cloth to prevent it from drying and leave it in room temperature for 2 hours.</li><br>
                    <li>After about 2 hours, cut the dough in 6 x 280 grams or desired amount.</li> <br>
                    <li>Store doughs in the fridge for at least 1 day before cooking for better results.<br>

                    </li><br>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>Directions</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Using a small amount of flour, dust your work surface and pizza peel.</li><br>

                    <li>Stretch the pizza dough out to 10-16 inches and lay it out on your pizza peel.</li><br>

                    <li>Top with sauce, followed by the mozzarella and olive oil, spreading both evenly on the dough and leaving room for cornicione (crust) , or crust (about 1/2 inch).</li><br>
