    <h1>Authentic Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe</h1>
    <p>An authentic spaghetti carbonara is a Roman pasta dish made with just a few high-quality ingredients: pasta, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork cheek), and black pepper. No cream, garlic, or onions—those are modern variations and not part of the traditional recipe.</p>
